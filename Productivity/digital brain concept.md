# The digital brain concept
## Why I am doing this

In my pursuit for a better way to learn and retain information, I have been researching the concept of the digital brain.

This is a concept that came to me on a blog post (https://www.swyx.io/tiago-forte-second-brain) and I have been curious about it for a while, on my daily life I have several topics that I love to read and study but that makes the hability to retain new things difficult. Over the time I realized that a method that allows me to retain information is writing it down in a notebook in the simplest way possible (usually I imagine that I'm explain it to my kid or nephew).

After a while I realized that my info was scattered in different places and I was not able to find it easily or at all destroying the concept completely, out of this I decided to look a simple tool and method that would allow me to find my info and organize it.

This is the idea behind this project.
